# DSA
Based on the constraints on n, we can use an algorithm of complexity corresponding to that range of n or lesser but not more, else we will face TLE.

# Stable and unstable sorting algorithms
A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the relative order of 2 objects with equal keys remains unchanged before and after the sort is performed.
Example : Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort

On the other hand, if the relative order changes before and after the sort, then it is said to be unstable algorithm.
Example : Quick Sort, Heap Sort

An unstable algorithm can be made stable by taking the position of the elements into consideration.
